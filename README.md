# Windows Server Active Directory Infrastructure

This project demonstrates my expertise in setting up and managing a Windows Server Active Directory (AD) infrastructure using VirtualBox. It showcases my ability to design, configure, and secure complex IT environments tailored to organizational needs.

Key Features
1. Network Topology Design
Designed a scalable network layout to support multiple departments and users.
Focused on efficiency, reliability, and security for small to mid-sized organizations.
2. Server Configuration
Configured Windows Server environments to act as Domain Controllers.
Enabled Active Directory services for user and resource management.
3. Active Directory Management
User Accounts & Organizational Units (OUs): Created and managed user accounts and structured OUs for simplified administration.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Defined and managed permissions for users and groups, ensuring proper resource access.
Group Policy Objects (GPOs): Designed and implemented GPOs to enforce configurations and security policies at the domain level.
4. Department-Specific Resource Management
Configured shared drives with granular access control, enhancing security and collaboration.
Enforced GPOs to secure access permissions and reduce security risks.
